BlackJack game is a guessing game that mimics the real life black Jack casino.

It is built with the technologies like Javascript, HTMl and CSS!

It is part of my curricular work on my career path of becoming a ReactDev at Scrimba.com!

I love the dynamism and the neatness of how this app is created because it covers the wide
range of topics in Javascripts!
